<p class="about">
      I did my undergraduate in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge and then moved to sunny California to do an MSc in Statistics at Stanford University. After a couple of years in California,
      I decided I miss the rain in the UK too much and moved to London to do a PhD in Mathematical Biology at UCL.
    <br>
      <br>
      My PhD thesis focused on evolutionary biology, specifically the question of the evolution of mating types and sexual dimorphism.
      Following my PhD I received an EPSRC Fellowship that funded me as a postdoc for two years. During this time I continued working on evolutionary biology
      (on questions like the evolution of mating types, mating type switching, germline evolution and the role of mitonuclear coadaptation in speciation)
      <br>
        <br>
      I also took advantage of the freedom my fellowship granted me to pursue my curiosity and interest in biophysics and pattern formation during development.
      This led to a collaborative project with Buzz Baum to study Notch-Delta mediated pattern formation and its rolein mediatingdevelopmental timing.
      I am currently also working with Jon Clarke and Paula Alexandre to understand how Notch signalling may control the spatial and temporal patterns of neuronal differentiation observed experimentally in the zebrafish.
  <br>
    <br>
      At the moment I amfunded by an HFSP Long Term Fellowship to work on morphogen transport and scaling during growth with Marcos Gonzalez-Gaitan at the Univerisity of Geneva and Frank Julicher at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems.
      My work involves developing new theory to tackle these topics as well as statistical and computational tools to help interpret experimental data.

I love dancing and watching people dance, luckily Geneva has a wonderful dance scene to discover and explore! If I am not dancing on weekends you can find me hiking or cycling on the beautiful Swiss mountains.

      I am interested in finding ways to improve communication between the scientific community and the general public, if you have any ideas or want to work togetheron thisfront please get in touch!
