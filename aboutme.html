<h1 class="aboutme">About me</h1>
<p class="about">
  I did my undergraduate in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge and then moved to sunny California to do an MSc in Statistics at Stanford University. After a couple of years in California, I decided I miss the rain in the UK too much and moved to London to do a PhD in Mathematical Biology at UCL. My thesis focused on evolutionary biology, specifically the question of the evolution of mating types and sexual dimorphism. Following my PhD I received an EPSRC Fellowship that funded me as a postdoc for two years. During this time I continued working on evolutionary biology (on questions like the evolution of mating types, mating type switching, germline evolution and the role of mitonuclear coadaptation in speciation). I also took advantage of the freedom myfellowship granted me to pursue my curiosity and interest in biophysics and pattern formation during development. This led to a collaborative project with Buzz Baum to study Notch-Delta mediated pattern formation and its coupling to developmental timing. You can have a look through my publications

I am currently funded by anHFSPLong Term Fellowship to work on morphogen transport and scaling during growth with Marcos Gonzalez-Gaitan at the Univerisity of Geneva and Frank Julicher at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems.
