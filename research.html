      <h1>Developmental patterning and Notch-Delta signaling </h1> I am interested in symmetry breaking and the emergence of patterns during development. Notch signaling is a highly conserved signaling pathway that plays a fundamental role in a plethora of processes including cell differentiation during the development
      and adult life of multicellular organisms. Notch signaling is a form of cell-cell communication, takes place locally between cells that are in direct contact with one another, and can lead to the self-organization of spatial patterns.
      <br>
      <br> I have worked closely with experimentalists to study the role of Notch signaling in the development of the Drosophila fly notum. We have shown that, in this system, Notch signaling acts like a developmental clock and is important for timely
      and robust pattern formation.
      <br>
      <br> I am also interested in the ways in which contact mediated signaling can lead to pattern formation, particularly when cells can reach one another at a distance through cellular protrusions. I am currently working on an interdisciplinary project
      that looks at spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal differentiation in the zebrafish spinal cord, likely to be mediated through Notch signaling.

      <h1>Growth control and scaling of morphogen gradients </h1> I am interested in growth control and the emergence of morphological structures during development. Morphogens are secreted factors that form graded concentration profiles in developing tissues through diffusion and degradation. Patterning emerges
      when cells activate different target genes as a function of the morphogen concentration that they sense. At the same time, morphogen signalling controls tissue and organismal growth. I am interested in this coupling between growth and patterning
      and its implications.
      <br>
      <br> Morphological structures can adapt to size as an organism grows. This is often attributed to the adaptation or scaling of the morphogen profile to the new tissue size. I am currently developing theory to understand how morphogen scaling occurs
      during development. I am also working closely with experimentalists in the Gonzalez-Gaitan lab to develop statistical tools that allow us to quantify the transport kinetics of the morphogen and growth factor Dpp in the developing wing of the fruitfly.

      <h1>Mating type evolution </h1> Sex requires the fusion of two cells. Mating gametes (sexual cells) are rarely the same, exhibiting some form of morphological, functional or genetic difference. This pattern extends to isogamous species whose gametes lack any sort of morphological
      or behavioral asymmetry yet posses self-incompatible gametes. In this case, gamete identity is determined genetically at the mating type locus. Why should species whose gametes look and behave in the same way evolve mating types? What specifies
      the number of mating types, which can vary from two up to several thousand? Why do some unicellular species such as yeasts and many ciliates determine their mating type identity stochastically? And how can the evolution of the mating type locus
      help us understand how sex chromosomes, anisogamy and sexes have evolved? My research addresses these questions using tools and concepts from evolutionary theory, genetics and physics.

      <h1>  Mitochoxndrial inheritance </h1> We inherit our mother’s mitochondria and so do most multicellular organisms. Uniparental inheritance of mitochondria is also common amongst unicellular organisms. Why is this pattern of inheritance so widespread? And what can we infer about the
      evolution of mating types or speciation through the lens of the mitochondrial genome and its inheritance patterns? I am interested in addressing these questions both by developing new theory and by working with experimentalists that study mitochondrial
      genetics.
